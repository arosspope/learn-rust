//We use the extern crate command to bring the communicator library crate into scope, because our package actually now contains two crates.
//Cargo treats src/main.rs as the root file of a binary crate, which is separate from the existing library crate whose root file is src/lib.rs.

//Also note that even if we're using an external crate within a submodule of our project,
//the extern crate should go in our root module (so in src/main.rs or src/lib.rs)
